Fibonacci Future Mode:
The mode used was 'FUTURE_SHARED'. This is because each future in the future array needs to be accessed twice.
The fibonacci value at N is N-1 + N-2 and 
the fibonaacci value at N+1 is N + N-1
Here, 'N-1' was accessed twice , for calculating N and N+1. 
This happens for all elements in the series except perhaps teh first and last two elements.

The 'FUTURE_EXCLUSIVE ' mode allows each future data to be consumed/accessed once only which will not be enough for calculating fibonacci.
